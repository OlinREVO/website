The team explores and builds off existing concepts to create electric vehicles for learning as well as competition. Different sub-teams exist to serve the interests of our members: Chassis, Powertrain, Sensing and Internal.</div></div></div><div class="main-footer"><div class="medium-text">SPONSORS</div><img src="/images/icons/arrow.png" class="arrow"></div></section><section class="blue-background"><div class="text-center"><img src="/images/sponsors/advanced_circuits.png" class="logo"><img src="/images/sponsors/aerospace_robotics.png" class="logo"><img src="/images/sponsors/gopro.png" class="logo"><img src="/images/sponsors/hawaiian_host.png" class="logo"></div><div class="text-center"><img src="/images/sponsors/manzanita.png" class="logo"><img src="/images/sponsors/spooky.png" class="logo"><img src="/images/sponsors/upverter.png" class="logo"><img src="/images/sponsors/zero.png" class="logo"></div><div class="text-center"><div class="medium-text">We Love Our Sponsors</div><div class="small-text text-block">We are so thankful to our sponsors. With their help we were able to build our first electric vehicle, the e-bike, and with their continued support and that of others we hope to have our electric racing kart ready to compete in Spring of 2014. If you like what we are doing or find this form of engineering education valuable, we hope you will also sponsor us. We're looking for individual and corporate donations of money, parts, and assistance.

If you think you can help out with what you produce or you even want something tested, we're ready to talk. Additionally, while we use the machining facilities offered by the college, we are still limited on what we can produce by hand. If you have machining, 3D printing, PCB making, or any other services you would like to donate, we can use all the help making parts we can get.</p><p class="medium-text nomb">Experience</p><p class="text-block">By principal REVO is a research organization dedicated to developing interesting EV components and devices. If you're a company that speciallizes in mechanical, electrical, or software engineering, we consider your advice and mentorship just as valuable as well. People and knowledge isn't free and we take your valuable hours into account if that's how you can sponsor us.  </p></div></div><div class="medium-text blue-text">Let's get in touch: james.nee@students.olin.edu</div><div class="text-center"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/OlinREVO"><img src="/images/icons/facebook.png" class="pad social"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/OlinREVO"><img src="/images/icons/twitter.png" class="pad social"></a><a href="https://olinrevo.tumblr.com/"><img src="/images/icons/tumblr.png" class="pad social"></a></div></section></div></body></html>
