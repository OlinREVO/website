                        REVO is a student run team that provides education, awareness and experience to their members in the field of electric vehicles. The team explores and builds off existing concepts to create electric vehicles for learning as well as competition. Different sub-teams exist to serve the interests of our members: Chassis, Powertrain, Sensing and Internal.

                    We Love Our Sponsors
                div.small-text.text-block.
                    We are so thankful to our sponsors. With their help we were able to build our first electric vehicle, the e-bike, and with their continued support and that of others we hope to have our electric racing kart ready to compete in Spring of 2014. If you like what we are doing or find this form of engineering education valuable, we hope you will also sponsor us. We're looking for individual and corporate donations of money, parts, and assistance.

                    p.medium-text.nomb Monetary Support 
                    p.text-block Even if you're not involved with a company directly related to the EV world or if you happen to be friends or family of team members, we can use as much funding as possible to buy the spare parts and hardware necessary to build our electric vehicles.

                    p.medium-text.nomb Parts and Services
                    p.text-block For companies who specialize in EV technology or are interested in entering the industry we love getting parts we can use on our competition vehicles or even testing out beta hardware to give feedback. If you think you can help out with what you produce or you even want something tested, we're ready to talk. Additionally, while we use the machining facilities offered by the college, we are still limited on what we can produce by hand. If you have machining, 3D printing, PCB making, or any other services you would like to donate, we can use all the help making parts we can get.

                    p.medium-text.nomb Experience
                    p.text-block By principal REVO is a research organization dedicated to developing interesting EV components and devices. If you're a company that speciallizes in mechanical, electrical, or software engineering, we consider your advice and mentorship just as valuable as well. People and knowledge isn't free and we take your valuable hours into account if that's how you can sponsor us.
